# Summary

The East Region Therapeutic Services team uses flat files to generate reports to better serve people in the state supported by DDA to live happy and full lives. A major aspect of reporting considers adverse events to identify where and for whom supportive services can be improved. This repo contains R Quarto markdown documents to generate static, internal reports on adverse events including falls, skin breakdown, choking, aspiration, and pneumonia. To generate reports, you will need access to flat files with the format used by the team and also see @sec-function.

# Motivation

The DDA therapeutic services team in the east region keeps event records for people supported by the state so that they can ultimately tailor therapeutic services to meet individual needs. This is achieved through agency training and advocacy on behalf of supported people. However, retrieving actionable information from event data is time prohibitive with reporting methods in Excel and due to their various consultative roles.

When considering alternative software for the team, `R` is a verified coding language available for state employees to use. These report templates use the `R` coding language to import Excel files and create tables that would typically be done completely within Excel.

# Function {#sec-function}

The repo supports three methods to generate reports: by 1) a containerized R Shiny app, 2) R Shiny app with R and RStudio, and 3) Quarto at the command line interface.

## Method 1) R Shiny app with DesktopDeployR

A containerized app can be used to generate reports using the [DesktopDeployR](https://github.com/wleepang/DesktopDeployR) framework. This method is the easiest because it doesn't require a full installation of R/R Studio and runs discretely without you having to explicitly open other software. To use the app on a local server, download the `MyApplication` folder and install [R-portable](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rportable/) and [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases) into `MyApplication/dist`. You can contact me for an installer of a complete `MyApplication` folder. Open the `.bat` file and the app will open in a browser window.

## Method 2) R Shiny App with R Markdown

The app (`ReporTN/app.R`) uses `.rmd` files to make reports. Within R Studio, navigate to `ReporTN/app.R` and run the app.

## Method 3) CLI with Quarto

The command line interface uses `.qmd` files to make reports. Update parameters in `.yml` files (in the `params` folder) for source data and time span of the report. Reports and their corresponding `.yml` files match by leading numbers (like `1_`).

Here is an example of an updated `.yml` file:

``` default
1 ---
2 census_path: "E:/2023 Agency Census Listing.xlsx"
3 current_falls_path: "E:/2023 - FALLS Event Tracking.xlsx"
4 previous_falls_path: "E:/2022 - FALLS Event Tracking.xlsm"
5 year: "2023"
6 months: "NA"                                               # <1>
```

1.  Use `months: "NA"` to make an annual report and `["01", "02", "03"]` (MM syntax for month) to make a Q1 report.

Execute a prompt like this one from the command line to make the report:

``` default
quarto render 1_falls.qmd --execute-params params/1_fall.yml
```

# Requirements

Check these criteria before using report templates.

## All methods:

1.  Flat files with source data (`.xlsx`/`.xlsm`) should have the same column arrangements and data types as indicated in `.titles/event_titles.xlsx`. If necessary, rearrange the source data rather than modifying the `event_titles.xlsx` file.

## Methods 2 and 3:

2.  Have R and [R Studio](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html "Installing R and RStudio") (or stand-alone [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ "Get Started") with your preferred IDE) installed.
