# Summary

The East Region Therapeutic Services team uses flat files to generate
reports to better serve people in the state supported by DIDD to live
happy and full lives. A major aspect of reporting considers adverse
events to identify where and for whom supportive services can be
improved. This repo contains R Quarto markdown documents to generate
static, internal reports on adverse events including falls, skin
breakdown, choking, aspiration, and pneumonia. To generate reports, you
will need access to flat files with the format used by the team and also
see <a href="#sec-use" class="quarto-xref">SectionÂ 3</a>.

# Motivation

The DIDD therapeutic services team in the east region is comprised of
subject-matter experts in occupational and speech therapy. They keep
excellent event records for people supported by the state so that they
can ultimately tailor therapeutic services to meet individual needs.
This is achieved through agency training and advocacy on behalf of
supported people. However, retrieving actionable information from event
data is time prohibitive due to their various consultative roles.

When considering alternative software for the team, `R` is a verified
coding language available for state employees to use. These report
templates use the `R` coding language to import Excel files and create
tables that would typically be done completely within Excel.

# How to use the `.qmd` templates

Check these criteria before using report templates.

1.  Flat files with source data (`.xlsx`/`.xlsm`/`.csv`) should have the
    same columns arrangements and data types as indicated in
    `.titles/event_titles.xlsx`. If necessary, rearrange the source data
    rather than modifying the `event_titles.xlsx` file.

2.  Have R and [R
    Studio](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html "Installing R and RStudio")
    (or stand-alone
    [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ "Get Started") with
    your preferred IDE) installed.

Currently, the project uses the command line interface to generate
reports and pass parameters to `.qmd` files. I chose this design to
reduce the need to open `.qmd` documents and edit them directly.
However, the user needs to update parameters in `.yml` files (in the
`params` folder) for source data and time span of the report. Reports
and their corresponding `.yml` files match by leading numbers (like
`1_`).

Here is an example of an updated `.yml` file:

``` default
1 ---
2 census_path: "E:/2023 Agency Census Listing.xlsx"
3 current_falls_path: "E:/2023 - FALLS Event Tracking.xlsx"
4 previous_falls_path: "E:/2022 - FALLS Event Tracking.xlsm"
5 year: "2023"
6 months: "NA"
```

Line 6  
Use `months: "NA"` to make an annual report and `["01", "02", "03"]` (MM
syntax for month) to make a Q1 report.

To generate a report, execute a prompt like this one from the command
line:

``` default
quarto render 1_falls.qmd --execute-params params/1_fall.yml
```

# Future directions

The project can be improved by making an offline R Shiny app interface
so that the templates can be better used by the RTST team members
directly to make their reports.
